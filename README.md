# Beyond DND Beyond

### This website is for Dungeon Masters who run Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition. It is a way to track player characters as well as enemies and non-playable characters statistics, weapons, and spells. This allows game masters to keep those statistics handy in game and allows them to update characters as they level up in the campaign
